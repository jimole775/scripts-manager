# Auto Click Script Runner

This script executes the automation flows generated by the Auto Click Editor.

## Requirements

To run this script fully, you may need to install automation libraries depending on your needs:

- **System Automation**: `npm install robotjs` or `npm install @nut-tree/nut-js`
- **Global Shortcuts**: `npm install iohook` (Note: requires native build)

## Usage

```bash
node src/scripts/auto-click/runner.js <path-to-config.json>
```

## Configuration

The config file is a JSON export from the Vue Flow editor, containing `nodes` and `edges`.

## Implementation Details

- **Flow Control**: The runner traverses the graph based on `success` or `fail` outcomes of each node.
- **Node Types**:
  - `sleep`: Pauses execution.
  - `text`: Types text (mocked).
  - `image`: Searches for image on screen (mocked).
  - `dom`: Interaction with DOM elements (mocked).
